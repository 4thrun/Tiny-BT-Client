# Tiny BT Client

A simple Golang project for parsing and downloading files based on BitTorrent\.

## How to?

1. Build your \.exe file and give it a name, "Tiny-BT-Client" or something else\.

2. Put \.exe and \.torrent in the same directory and launch downloading with a single command:

   ```
   > [the .exe] [the .torrent] [the output]
   ```

   For example:

   ```
   > Tiny-BT-Client.exe debian-edu-10.9.0-amd64-netinst.iso.torrent debian-download.iso
   ```

3. Wait and wait and wait\.
